## 1. Anna

**Age**: 25 years old
**Occupation**: Housewife
**Status**: Pregnant

**Character Profile**:
A gentle and kind young pregnant woman who deeply loves her husband Jimmy. She has a strong character, silently supporting the family through poverty, full of hope for the future. She is unaware that her husband committed crimes for her and their child, making her the most innocent victim in this tragedy. Her voice should be gentle, caring, with maternal warmth, but also revealing the weariness brought by hardship.

**Voice Characteristics**: Gentle, soft, hopeful yet slightly weary

**Dialogue Example**:
"[gentle, warm] Jimmy, you're home? [caring] How was work today? [soft] I heated up some soup for you... [hopeful but slightly weary] The baby kicked me several times today, he must really want to meet his daddy..."

## 2. Jimmy

**Age**: 28 years old
**Occupation**: Chef at Blue Moon Cabaret
**Identity**: Illegal immigrant (Greek descent)

**Character Profile**:
A brooding and calculating Greek immigrant chef who speaks broken English with a heavy accent. His limited English makes him speak carefully, choosing words deliberately, which masks his calculating nature. Beneath his quiet, struggling-with-language exterior lies a volatile mix of desperation, resentment, and self-preservation instinct. He kills Webb not just for family, but to escape his own crushing sense of failure and powerlessness. His voice should shift between tense restraint and sudden intensity, with a thick Greek accent and imperfect grammar. Speech pace varies dramatically - from slow, deliberate calculation to rushed, fractured panic when his justifications crack. His tone carries bitter self-interest masked as sacrifice, revealing a man who chose murder as much for himself as for his family.

**Voice Characteristics**: Calculating yet volatile, heavy Greek accent, broken English, deliberate word choice, bitter undertones, self-justifying, variable pace (from slow deliberation to rushed panic)

**Dialogue Example**:
"[tense, restrained, struggling with words] Mr. Webb... you no take this business... [voice tightening, urgent, broken English] something bad... bad thing will happen... [sudden intensity, heavy accent] I HEAR 'Whale' is dangerous man. [suddenly quieter, threatening undertone] You... you must be careful... Very careful. [bitter laugh, self-mocking] I am sorry, I just... [voice hardening, calculating, deliberate] I just think... what is best for all people. [emphasized, darker, forceful] For ALL of us."

## 3. Morrison (Detective)

**Age**: 42 years old
**Occupation**: Senior Detective, Chicago Police Department

**Character Profile**:
A corrupt police officer with weak principles who thoroughly believes in the law of the jungle - survival of the fittest. Bought by "Whale" due to gambling debts, he becomes an accomplice in framing Zack. He's not very smart and easily caught making mistakes, but he's violent and arrogant. When faced with hard evidence, he will compromise to protect himself. His voice should be rough and threatening, carrying police professional habits, but revealing inner greed and bluster.

**Voice Characteristics**: Rough, threatening, impatient, arrogant, slightly sarcastic

**Dialogue Example**:
"[mocking, sarcastic] Zack Brennan, Notre Dame Law School graduate, [scornful laugh] look at you now? [threatening, rough] Don't count on your old law firm colleagues to help you, [dismissive] they've long forgotten you. [aggressive, final] The evidence is solid, you're the killer!"

## 4. Mrs. Morrison

**Age**: 38 years old
**Occupation**: Housewife

**Character Profile**:
A cold and selfish housewife who appears gentle and caring on the surface, but is actually living a loveless marriage with Morrison. She only cares about the status of being Mrs. Morrison and the comfortable life it provides, not caring where her husband's money comes from. She is shrewd and good at protecting her own interests. Her voice should be superficially elegant and polite, but lacking genuine warmth, revealing calculation and coldness.

**Voice Characteristics**: Superficially gentle, polite, courteous, lacking genuine emotion, shrewd

**Dialogue Example**:
"[polite, superficially warm] Welcome, Mr. Brennan. [courteous, practiced] Please sit down, let me pour you some coffee. [casual, detached] Morrison did leave early this morning, [matter-of-fact] he said he was going to work on a case... [slightly dismissive] What specific case, I'm not quite sure, [calculated innocence] after all I'm just a housewife..."

## 5. Rosa

**Age**: 38 years old
**Occupation**: Cleaning woman at Blue Moon Cabaret
**Family**: Single mother with a sick daughter

**Character Profile**:
A talkative and rambling single mother cleaning worker. She is essentially kind but weak, forced to participate in framing due to threats from Morrison about her sick daughter. When nervous, she talks more and faster, explaining and apologizing, trying to fill fear with words. Her voice should be anxious, rambling, full of maternal sorrow, constantly repeating and explaining while speaking.

**Voice Characteristics**: Anxious, rambling, fast-paced, repetitive, fearful, maternal

**Dialogue Example**:
"[anxious, stuttering] I... I was in the basement the whole time! [desperate, fast-paced] Really! Over by the wine cellar, organizing bottles and shelves... [rambling, nervous] very busy... was there the whole time... [panicked] I didn't see anything! [increasingly frantic] No no no, I mean the basement was very quiet, I just... just kept working... [fearful] don't know anything... [maternal desperation] I have a daughter to take care of... [pleading, near tears] she's sick, needs money for treatment... sir, please..."

---

## 6. Tommy

**Age**: 35 years old
**Occupation**: Manager at Blue Moon Cabaret
**Years of Service**: 5 years

**Character Profile**:
A timid, cautious, and stuttering manager. He stutters noticeably when nervous, with unstable speaking pace. He participated in Webb's blackmail network but retained his conscience, knowing "the rules of this business," hiding the truth to keep his job. He sympathizes with Vivian's situation but is powerless to help. His voice should be nervous, stuttering, with an intellectual refinement, but revealing inner fear and conflict.

**Voice Characteristics**: Nervous, stuttering, unstable pace, refined, fearful, conflicted

**Dialogue Example**:
"[surprised, nervous] Mr. Brennan? [stuttering, timid] So... so late to come... [hesitant] is there... is there anything I can help you with? [defensive, stuttering more] I... I was in the office the whole time! [explaining rapidly] End of the month, need to... to balance the books, you know... [rambling, intellectual] accounts, scheduling, inventory... [voice shaking] these all need... need me to handle... [pleading, fearful] I'm just a... just a working man, [desperate] have a family to feed..."

## 7. Vivian

**Age**: 26 years old
**Occupation**: Singer/Dancer at Blue Moon Cabaret

**Character Profile**:
A superficially charming and seductive singer with a heart full of pain and hatred. She once deeply loved Webb but was betrayed and exploited by him, forced into dirty work. Her love for Webb has transformed into deep hatred; she wrote a breakup letter and tore up her ticket to France. Her voice should be superficially seductive and alluring, but when alone or emotionally agitated, it reveals deep pain, anger, and despair.

**Voice Characteristics**: Superficially seductive, charming, but internally painful, angry, desperate, complex emotions

**Dialogue Example**:
"[seductive, smooth, performing] Good evening, gentlemen... [charming, alluring] Tonight I present to you 'Blue Moonlight'... [transition to alone, voice dropping] Everything he promised me was a lie... [bitter, painful] Three whole years... [angry, frustrated] I've had enough... [defiant, resentful] I'm not his doll, [building rage] nor am I a pawn he can manipulate at will..."

**Morrison**: "[threatening, aggressive] You better have evidence, or I'll arrest you too!"

**Zack**: "[probing deeper] Did Webb mention anyone he was waiting for last night?"

**Tommy**: "[fearful, speaking faster] That I... I really don't know. [evasive, stuttering] Mr. Webb's private meetings, generally wouldn't... wouldn't tell me these things... [pleading] Mr. Brennan... [desperate self-justification] I'm just a... just a working man. [frightened] Some things... what I shouldn't ask I don't ask.
